# Private Extension Manager

[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

Private Extension Manager lets you find, install, and update extensions from any
NPM registry. This lets you distribute organization-specific extensions using a
private registry server such as [Sonatype Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/product-nexus-repository)
or [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org).

# Managing Extensions

Select the **Private Extensions** icon on the activity bar:

![Activity Bar Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joelspadin-garmin/vscode-private-extension-manager/master/extension/media/readme/activity-bar.png)

This works similarly to Visual Studio Code's built-in extensions manager and
allows you to install, update, and uninstall private extensions.

By default, the view will be empty. You will need to publish extensions to your
private registry and tell the extension manager how to find the registry before
you can use it.

# Setup

## Publishing Extensions

To allow Private Extension Manager to find your extension,
[package it in the VSIX format using vsce](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension),
create an NPM package containing the .vsix file, and publish it to an NPM
registry. Your extension's `package.json` must contain a `files` array with the
path to the .vsix file so the extension manager knows what to install. Use
`vsce package` in a [`prepublishOnly` script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts)
to ensure that your NPM packages always contain an up-to-date extension package.

Note that when Private Extension Manager displays the details for an extension,
it will unpack the latest version of the NPM package to read its README and
CHANGELOG files, but it will not unpack the .vsix file. If your extension has an
icon, ensure that it is either accessible via HTTPS or included directly in your
NPM package by referencing it in the `package.json`'s `files` array.

Visual Studio Code does not support scoped extension names such as
`@my-org/my-extension`. It is recommended that you create a registry that only
contains Visual Studio Code extensions to avoid name collisions. If you need to
publish to a registry that contains packages that are not Visual Studio Code
extensions, add a `keywords` field to your `package.json` and tag all your
extensions with the same keyword so you can filter to just extensions, or ensure
that all non-extension packages are scoped.

Use `publishConfig` to set the registry to which the extension should be
published. You may also need to authenticate with this registry using
`npm login --registry=<url>`. Use `npm publish .` to publish your extension
(not `vsce publish`, as that publishes to the public extensions gallery).

Your `package.json` should look like a regular
[extension manifest](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/extension-manifest)
but with extra `files` and `publishConfig` fields and a `prepublishOnly` script
to handle the NPM-specific behavior:

```JSON
{
    "name": "example-extension",
    "displayName": "Example Extension",
    "description": "This is an example extension.",
    "version": "1.2.3",
    "author": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "John.Doe@garmin.com"
    },
    "publisher": "garmin",
    "engines": {
        "vscode": "^1.40.0"
    },
    "icon": "media/icon.png",
    "files": [
        "extension.vsix",
        "media/icon.png"
    ],
    "publishConfig": {
        "registry": "https://my-private.registry"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "prepublishOnly": "vsce package -o extension.vsix",
        ...
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "vsce": "^1.69.0",
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

**Note:** `prepare` scripts will **not** be run before installing the extension.
If you have native dependencies, instead of using node-gyp to build them on the
user's machine, you should build them yourself for each supported platform and
include them in the .vsix or host them on a server and have your extension
download them at runtime.

### OS specific Extensions

By default, the first .vsix file in the files array is used. If you have different
native dependencies for each platform, you can use osSpecificVsix to choose a .vsix
file by the [operating system](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_platform).

```JSON
    ...
    "osSpecificVsix": {
        "linux": "extension-linux.vsix",
        "win32": "extension-win32.vsix",
        "default": "extension-default.vsix",
    },
    ...
```

The package must include all files listed. `default` (_optional_) is used to select
a file in case none of the explicit keys matches; otherwise an error is shown on
unsupported platforms.

## Discovering Extensions

Now that your extensions are published to an NPM registry, you need to tell
Private Extension Manager how to find them. This can be done using a workspace
config file and/or a user setting.

### Workspace Configuration

Private Extension Manager uses a config file similar to Visual Studio Code's
`extensions.json` to allow workspaces to recommend extensions. Create a file
named `.vscode/extensions.private.json` in any workspace folder to define your
private extension registries and any recommended extensions. You can use the
**Private Extensions: Configure Recommended Extensions** or
**Private Extensions: Configure Workspace Registries** commands to open this
file, creating it from a template if it does not already exist.

The file has the following structure:

```JSON
{
    "registries": [
        {
            "name": "My Private Registry",
            "registry": "https://my-private.registry",
        }
    ],
    "recommendations": [
        "garmin.example-extension"
    ]
}
```

The `registries` array defines one or more NPM registries to search for private
extensions. Each item supports the following fields:

-   **name**: Name to display for the registry.
-   **registry**: (Optional) The address of the NPM registry which contains the extension packages.
    If omitted, the registry is determined according to standard [NPM config files](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/npmrc).
-   **query**: (Optional) Display only packages that match this [search query](https://github.com/npm/registry/blob/master/docs/REGISTRY-API.md#get-v1search).
    This is either an array of search terms or a string with space-delimited terms.
    For example, `"keywords:group1 keywords:group2"` would display only packages
    that have the either of the keywords `group1` or `group2`.
-   **enablePagination**: (Optional) If `true`, keep requesting more package results from the registry
    until it gives an empty response. If `false`, make only one request. This defaults to `true`.
    Set it to false when using a server that doesn't properly handle the `from` parameter of the NPM search API.
    You may also need to increase `limit` to get all results if this is disabled.
-   **limit**: (Optional) Number of results to limit each query to when requesting package results. Default: 100.
-   Any options supported by [npm-registry-fetch](https://github.com/npm/npm-registry-fetch#-fetch-options).
    Use these if you need to set authentication, a proxy, or other options.

The `recommendations` array is an optional list of private extensions from any
of the registries which should be recommended for users of the workspace.
The identifier of an extension is always `"${publisher}.${name}"`.
For example: `"garmin.private-extension-manager"`.

You may have multiple workspace folders that contain an `extensions.private.json`
file. The extension manager will display the registries and recommendations from
all of them.

**Note:** if the `query` option is omitted, the query text will be a single
asterisk. Some registry servers such as Verdaccio do not respond to this with
all available packages, so you may need to set `query` to get any results at all.

### User Configuration

Each user may also specify registries to use regardless of which workspace is
open with the `privateExtensions.registries` setting. This has the same format
as the `registries` array in `extensions.private.json`.

You can use the **Private Extensions: Add Registry...** and
**Private Extensions: Remove Registry** commands to quickly edit this setting.

### Global Configuration

Registries and recommendations can also be read from a file `extensions.private.json` in the extension's storage folder:

-   Windows: `%appdata%\\Code\\User\\globalStorage\\garmin.private-extension-manager`
-   Linux: `~/.vscode-server/data/User/globalStorage/garmin.private-extension-manager`

This file allows for setting registries and recommendations for a user, but separate from their personal VS Code user settings. The global configuration is aimed at organisations being able to set registries and recommendation for all users by placing this file in each user's global storage folder, such as with a group policy.

The file is read only on launch of VS Code as it shouldn't be getting changed too often, so if changes are made then you'll need to do a restart. It has the same format as the workspace configuration file.

### Custom Channels

It is possible to create tracking channels by using npm dist-tags when
publishing a private extension. This lets you publish pre-release or other
special versions of an extension without updating all users to them. Only users
who are tracking the specific release channel will get the updates.

#### Tracking a Channel

To switch release channels for an extension, install the extension, then
right-click it in the extensions list and select **Switch Release Channels...**.
Alternatively, click the **Channel** button on the extension details page.

You can manually select channels with the `privateExtensions.channels` settings
object. This is a dictionary where each key is an extension identifier
(`"${publisher}.${name}"`) and each name is the dist-tag to track, as shown in
the example below:

```JSON
"privateExtensions.channels": {
    "garmin.example-1": "insiders", // Tracks the 'insiders' dist-tag
    "garmin.example-2": "beta",     // Tracks the 'beta' dist-tag
    "garmin.example-3": "1.0.0"     // Pins the extension to version 1.0.0
}
```

You can also pin an extension to a specific version by listing the version
instead of a dist-tag. Private Extension Manager will not notify you of updates
to a pinned extension, so you can use this to temporarily ignore newer versions
of an extension.

#### Publishing to a Channel

To publish an extension to a channel, simply specify the channel name using
[npm dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag) when publishing. By default,
all packages will reference the `latest` tag.

```
npm publish . --tag=insiders
```

When publishing pre-release versions, it is reccomended to use pre-release
sematic versioning, such as **1.0.0-beta.0**.

## Extension Updates

Private Extension Manager will periodically check your installed extensions for
updates and notify you if any are found. You can adjust the check interval or
disable it with the `privateExtensions.updateCheckInterval` setting.

The Private Extensions sidebar panel will also indicate any extensions with new
versions with a green arrow. Clicking it will update the extension.

You will typically need to reload the Visual Studio Code window for an update
to take effect.

## Remote Development

When using a [remote development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview)
extension such as [Remote-SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh),
install the [Private Extension Manager: Remote Helper](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Garmin.private-extension-manager-remote-helper)
extension to give Private Extension Manager access to the local machine.

Private Extension Manager will attempt to infer where VS Code will install an
extension. If it shows "Install Locally" for a workspace extension or vice versa,
[set the `extensionKind` property](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/remote-extensions#incorrect-execution-location)
in your extension's `package.json` to tell both VS Code and Private Extension
Manager where the extension should be installed.

## Troubleshooting

If you are successfully connecting to a private NPM registry and don't see any
errors, but you don't see any extensions either, first open the Output panel
(Ctrl+Shift+U) and check the dropdown list for "Private Extension Manager".
If it is present, it may contain information as to why extension packages are
being discarded.

If packages aren't being discarded, they may not be found to begin with. If you
do not specify a `query` or other options in your registry configuration, the
default search query is:

```
{registry-url}/-/v1/search?text=*&size=20&from=0
```

Check how your registry server responds to this. Some servers such as Verdaccio
do not respond to `text=*` with a list of all packages, so you may need to
change the `query` option for your registry (see the **Workspace Configuration**)
section above.

## Privacy Statement

When communicating with the private extension servers you have configured, the
extension will not transmit any data beyond what is necessary to establish the
connection. The extension will not transmit any data back to Garmin.
